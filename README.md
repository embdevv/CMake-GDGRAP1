This repository demonstrates a C++ OpenGL application for loading and manipulating 3D models (.obj format) with real-time transformations using keyboard controls. Features a shader-based rendering pipeline with GLM matrix operations for translation, rotation, and scaling.
Purpose
This project is intended for educational purposes ONLY to demonstrate:

OpenGL rendering pipeline implementation
Shader programming (vertex & fragment shaders)
3D transformation matrices using GLM
Keyboard input handling with GLFW
Loading and rendering .obj models with TinyObjLoader

⚠️ Important Notice
Do NOT copy/replicate this code directly. This repository is meant to help you understand the concepts line by line. Take time to comprehend how each component works—from shader compilation to matrix transformations—and implement your own version based on your understanding.
Tech Stack

C++ - Core programming language
CMake - Build system
